## About the Site

### Primary Goal

The goal of **UniSphere** is to help university students stay connected with the campus community by providing a platform where they can view and join events, courses, and communities based on their interests. The platform also allows admins and event organizers to manage and approve activities, issue tickets, and provide opportunities for student engagement.

### Target Users

UniSphere is designed for:

- **University students** looking for events, courses, and communities to join based on their interests.
- **Event organizers** and **admins** who manage and approve events, courses, and community memberships.
- **Faculty and staff** who want to engage with students through academic resources and events.
- **Users** who want to rate events and interact with others in the community.

## Agile Methodology

The **UniSphere** project followed **Agile methodologies** to ensure a flexible and iterative development process. We used a [Kanban board on GitHub](https://github.com/users/joeht112/projects/3/views/1) to track user stories and manage progress in stages: "Backlog", "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

### Workflow Breakdown

1. **Backlog**: All user stories were initially added to the backlog and prioritized using MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won’t Have).
2. **To Do**: Stories prioritized as "Must Have" were worked on first, followed by "Should Have" and "Could Have".
3. **In Progress**: Features under active development.
4. **Done**: Stories moved here once all acceptance criteria were met and tested.

### **All User Stories**

| #  | Title of User Story                                      | MoSCoW Prioritization | Sprint Number |

| 9  | View About page with developer info                      | Could Have             | Sprint 3      |
| 10 | Implement interest-based event and course matching      | Won’t Have             

## User Experience (UX)
